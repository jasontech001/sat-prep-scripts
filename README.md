# 🧠 SAT Prep Scripts (Python)

This repo contains small Python scripts that help with SAT math prep and general problem solving.

## ✅ Tools Included
- `percentage_calculator.py` – Find % of a number
- `quadratic_solver.py` – Solve ax² + bx + c = 0
- `fraction_simplifier.py` – Reduce fractions like 12/20 ➝ 3/5
- `mean_median.py` – Calculate mean & median of numbers

## 🧠 Why I Built This
I’m preparing for the SAT and decided to build tools using Python as I study. It helps me revise and improve my coding at the same time.

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Algebra helper
- Geometry formula quizzer
- Basic graphing support
